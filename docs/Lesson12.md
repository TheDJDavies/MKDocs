# Lesson 12 - Variables

Variables will store data in its memory

Primitive variable types are: numbers, booleans & strings

Whole number = INTEGER [because why should programmers not speak bloody english??]

Decimal number = FLOAT / FLOATING POINT NUMBER [seriously guys...]

Booleans need to be capitalised
