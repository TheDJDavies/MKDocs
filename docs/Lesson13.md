# Lesson 13 - Variable Names

Don't use shorthand for variable names (think like lab books)

Variables are all lowercase:

* This is in line with PEP 8 which gives guidance as to which formatting is required
* The formatting is dependant on usage. For functions and variables, this is all lowercase.

Words separated by underscore `example_words_seperated`

autopep8 cannot distinguish separate words or determine which formatting is required
