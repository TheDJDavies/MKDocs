# Lesson 5 - Python Extension

Convert VSCode to an IDE using an extension called `python`

IDE will add addtional functions:

1. Linting [analysing code for potential errors]
2. Debugging [finding an fixing errors]
3. AutoCompletion [I guess it's just tabbing?? Any need for an IDE?]
4. Code Formatting [propper formatting]
5. Unit Testing [test the code to ensure desired outcomes]
6. Code Snippets [re-usable code blocks]

Python extension is already installed on my VSCode. This is why the above seemed so familiar.

We can now run code using the play button on the top right.
