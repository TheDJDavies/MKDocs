# Lesson 3 - Code Editors

Writing python code can be done using either:

1. Code editor {e.g. VSCode, Atom or Sublime}
2. IDE [Integrated Development Environment] {e.g. PyCharm or Visual Studio Code}


An IDE is a code editor with additional features. e.g. autocompletion, debugging & testing

This course will use VSCode aka Visual Studio Code. Later we will use an extenstion/plug-in to convert it to an IDE

Visual Studio Code is already on my system.
